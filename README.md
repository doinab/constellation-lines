# Constellation line figures in sky cultures across the world
## (a referenced dataset)


An accessible, Creative-Commons-licenced, documented, and referenced dataset of constellation line figures (or connect-the-dot figures) from _sky cultures_ (traditional astronomies) across the world and through time. This data was digitised from many scholarly sources.

Analyses of the data:

- Doina Bucur (2022) _The network signature of constellation line figures_. PLOS ONE 17(7): e0272270. <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272270>. Also a preprint, arXiv:2110.12329, available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12329>.
- Doina Bucur (2023). _The semantics of constellation line figures_. Preprint, arXiv:2306.17573, available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17573>.

The .json format is compatible with that of [Stellarium](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium-skycultures), such that the data can be reused there.

(Work in progress.)
