# Constellation line figures in sky cultures across the world
## (a referenced dataset)


An accessible, Creative-Commons-licenced, documented, and referenced dataset of constellations: most with line figures (or connect-the-dot figures) rather than only star groups. The constellations were documented in _sky cultures_ (traditional astronomies, from tribes to empires) across the world and through time. The data includes **culture metadata** and scholarly **sources**. The constellations are grouped by culture and annotated with **names**, text on the degree of **certainty** in its identification, a **description** (usually about practical usage or mythological themes for the constellation in that culture), the **semantics** of the constellation, and pointers to any known related constellations.

The data was digitised from many scholarly sources (see file _sources.bib_).

Analyses of the data:

- Doina Bucur (2022) _The network signature of constellation line figures_. PLOS ONE 17(7): e0272270. <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272270>. Also a preprint, arXiv:2110.12329, available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12329>.
- Doina Bucur (2023). _The semantics of constellation line figures_. Preprint, arXiv:2306.17573, available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17573>.

The .json format is compatible with that of [Stellarium](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium-skycultures), such that the data can be reused there.

(Work in progress.)
