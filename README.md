# Constellation line figures in sky cultures across the world
## (a referenced dataset)


An accessible, Creative-Commons-licenced, documented, and referenced dataset of constellation line figures (or connect-the-dot figures) from _sky cultures_ (traditional astronomies) across the world and through time. This data was digitised for the publication:

- Doina Bucur. The network signature of constellation line figures. arXiv e-prints. arXiv:2110.12329 [cs.SI]. 2021. Available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12329>.

The .json format is compatible with that of [Stellarium](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium-skycultures), such that the data can be reused there.

(In progress.)
