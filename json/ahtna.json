Characteristic is a principal constellation: the incarnated spirit of a Traveler figure who circled the world in Distant Time.",

      "description": "This is a meta-, whole-sky constellation; the individual body parts are explicitly separated in a table as asterisms. In local tradition, Nek’eltaeni was the first being to appear among the stars. Before going to the sky, he was the culture hero and Traveler figure known as Yabaaghe Tezyaann ('the one who went around the edge of the world') (and other similar names in Ahtna dialects), who transformed an archaic animal people into the present-day distinct animal species, and established peace and order on earth. He uses medicine power and is a model of compassion. Nek’eltaeni is a large man-animal or therianthrope figure composed of at least 18 asterisms named using body part terms. He wears a backpack (native: ughaele') and holds a walking stick/weapon/medicine staff (native: utets) in his left hand. The Milky Way is his trail (native: utene). His representation as a therianthrope or shapeshifter recalls ancient time when humans and animals were one.",
