      "description": "Humanoid constellation composed of 11 groups of named stars that span 76 degrees across the sky. It is said that an ordinary person shot him with an arrow, and the impact broke his back, which is why he has his hands thrown above his head with fingers splayed out. He kicked his legs and feet into the air, which pushed the sky up to where it is now. His head (ups UMa), the place where he was hit with the arrow (or the arrow itself) (g UMa), and the quiver for arrows (tet Boo) are unconnected."
