  "description": "Anuta is a small island in the SE of Solomon Islands in Melanesia, inhabited by a culturally Polynesian society. As for most Oceanic seafarers, the stars are the most important tool for long-range navigation. The major guiding stars and constellations are known as carriers (native: kaavenga), and have proper names. A star path or sequence of stars (native: kau panonga porau) is followed from one island to the next. This sky culture has 11 constellation line figures. Two other groups of stars are mentioned in the source, but are not identifiable. Culturally significant themes reflected in Anutan constellations include birds, food, fish, and equipment used to procure or prepare these items. Many of these constellations are identified by similar names on other islands. The source draws each constellation with both stars and lines, and marks the Western constellation where this is placed. However, it only identifies the major stars by name, so marking the minor ones was guesswork based on the author's drawing.",

      "description": "The dominant constellation for Anutans. It can be seen in all seasons and has practical navigational utility. From one wing tip to the other, it stretches across a quarter of the sky. Birds have symbolic prominence. Canoes are likened to birds, the sky is dominated by the Bird, and also the voyagers are metaphorically depicted as birds in poetry and song. In keeping with the theme of voyaging and navigation, the bird has a masculine identity, is an instigator of activity, with the freedom to move at will."
