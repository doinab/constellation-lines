  "description": "The Lower Tanana sky culture is the result of fieldwork with Northern Dene peoples, investigating how they conceptualize and integrate the sky into systems of knowledge, practices, cosmology, and spirituality. Characteristic is a principal constellation: the incarnated spirit of a Traveler figure who circled the world in Distant Time. An additional unidentified constellation represents a malevolent being.",

      "description": "A whole-sky constellation associated with the Traveler, spans approximately 117 degrees and is composed of at least 25 groups of stars, of which 22 are named body parts. A man-animal figure,  Nogheyoli's heart (native: bedraya') (21 Lyn) is the embodiment of the things that the Traveler worked with while transforming the world. He wears a backpack (native: beghalaâ€™) and holds a spear/walking stick/medicine staff (native: bedechena') in his left hand. The constellation is remarkable for its details: five dim stars outline his hair (native: begho'); his right hand is divided into smaller groups of stars for his palm (native: belok'a), fingers (native: belots'ula'), and thumb (native: belochetth); his left foot is composed to two smaller groups that distinguish his toes (native: bekalats'ula') and heel (native: bekatwtl). Nogheyoli is in a defensive posture overhead. His right arm and hand are extended to stave off a malevolent being (an unidentified constellation, as in the Gwich'in sky culture). The toes and heel of his left foot are splayed out like talons, while his right leg and foot appear human. His left hand grips his spear, with distinct thumb, fingers, and wrist. His ears are standing upright like that of an alert animal. Big Dipper is his tail (native: becha'). His heart (21 Lyn) is unconnected. The same for the 5 stars of his hair (psi Aur) and his eyes (iot Aur, bet Tau)."
