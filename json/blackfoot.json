  "description": "The Blackfoot is an Algonquian-speaking tribe living in the northern Great Plains of North America. This sky culture has 4 constellation line figures, and names for the Milky Way, the Pleiades, the Orion Nebula, three planets and three stars. This data is a transcript of the broad survey of North-American astronomical traditions in the book Stars of the first people: Native American star myths and constellations [miller1997stars] (from page 243). The basic information is not collected by this recent author. It is attributed to anthropologists from the early 1900s: Mythology of the Blackfoot Indians published in 1908 [wissler1908mythology], and `The old north trail, or, Life, legends and religion of the Blackfeet Indians` published in 1910 [mcclintock1910old]. Source [miller1997stars] instead collects the data and draws the constellations explicitly, based on this early information. According to the sources, the Blackfoot often featured the Big Dipper, the Pleiades, and the Morning Star on their tipis, and believe that when people die, their spirits go into the sky and become stars, ever increasing the number of stars in the heavens. The sources include many associated star stories (not transcribed here), and mostly English names. Another constellation called Hand in the Sky has been documented, but was not identified (so is not in this dataset). It could be another name for the Spider Man's Fingers, or another constellation entirely. An associated story also explains a particular tipi design. ",
