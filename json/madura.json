  "description": "The Madurese have a maritime tradition. Like the Bugis and the Mandar, this probably originated with the Austronesians, who brought an advanced maritime technology with them when migrating to Java and Madura. There are still many fishing villages along the coast of Madura; some of the fishermen still use the stars and asterisms for navigation (alongside modern technology), while in other villages the fishermen still have the knowledge but do not use it any more. Some of the younger fishermen lost this traditional knowledge. The prefix bintang (star) is added to almost all stellar objects. They used the term Bintang tera' (Bright stars) when navigating to the north, with Bintang tera' bhiruh (Blue bright star) recognized as Vega. They also used the asterism Bintang Sekoh (Elbow stars), i.e., the Western Summer triangle (Vega–Altair–Deneb). When navigating to the south, they used Tara laok (alf and bet Cen). Their most popular asterism was Bintang Pe'-Kope'an, a kind of Madurese fish (the constellation Crux). For Madurese farmers, the most popular asterism was Bintang Nangghala (Plough), the central part of Orion. The Madurese culture leans heavily on the Javanese culture, especially wrt farming. Both cultures use the Pleiades and Orion as signs of farming time, and the names of stars and asterisms are quite similar, such as the Plough.",
