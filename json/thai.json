  "description": "These are said to be Thai indigenous asterisms, despite early influence from China and India.  The imported Indian lunar mansions are also used in Thailand for telling time, but are not included here. There are links to Malay, Java, Bugis, Madura, and Burma asterisms (the turtle and/or plough in Orion). The source interprets a primary source (in Thai) from 2012. Another source for explicitly drawn Thai asterisms was used to clarify some line figures. This was referenced and summarised online by a member of the public [http://archive.astronomerswithoutborders.org/member-reports/285-gam2015/gam-blog/2670-drawing-of-traditional-asterisms-in-thailand.html], is the book 'Tai Baan Doo Dao' (in Thai) by N. Pengkaew (2000), which appears to have some variants for both names and constellations. The Thai sources could not be obtained; only the follow-ups in English, [orchiston2021seasia] and (when the former was not clear) the URL above. Both identify the stars, but draw the constellations with pictographs, not line figures. These are simple enough to transcribe as line figures here following the perimeter of the pictographs.",
