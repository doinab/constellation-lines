      "description": "Yámǫréya is said to have invented Sahtúot’įnę technology, transformed flora and fauna, and shaped the landscape. His spirit incarnated in the stars as a protector, teacher, gamekeeper, and source of knowledge and power. He is composed of at least 11 groups of stars named as body parts. His heart (lam UMa) is not connected. The Big Dipper is his container or cooking vessel identified as Yı́hda or lıbóchə́. Aside from the Big Dipper, the stars are relatively inconspicuous, suggesting a specialized domain of knowledge. In comparison to the Gwich'in and Ahtna whole-sky constellations, Yámǫréya is less than half their size, spanning just over 64 degrees. "
