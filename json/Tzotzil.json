  "culture": "The Tzotzil are a modern, indigenous Maya people of the central Chiapas highlands in southern Mexico. As of 2000, they numbered under 300,000. The municipalities with the largest Tzotzil population are Chamula, San Cristóbal de las Casas, and Zinacantán (24,300), in the Mexican state of Chiapas.",
  "astronomy": "The Zinacantecos don't differentiate among stars, planets, and constellations; all are called k'anal (yellowish one). They are much more informed about the southern (rather than northern) sky, because their view of the northern sky is blocked by the high escarpment and mountains to the north, often covered in clouds. They thus do not see Polaris. Constellations 001-003, 009, and the Pleiades are commonly recognised by the Tzotzil of Zinacantán. 004-008 are identified only by older, more knowledgeable people. The continuity from classic to the modern Maya astronomy is impressive, although the people have had no astronomers any more (as the Maya did). In the intervening 500 years, they also lost their written documents containing the complete zodiacal constellations. The elders still use constellations to accurately tell time at night. The people continue to believe that many celestial bodies are living beings, much as the Maya did. However, the names given to these gods come from 16th-century Spanish Catholicism; crosses were also important symbolism to the Maya though. Their narratives synthesise pre-colonial and Christian themes.",
  "data summary": "The sources provide information on the astronomy of the Tzotzil of Zinacantán only, using other primary sources from the 20th century. The leading source is the paper [vogt1997zinacanteco], which covers the Tzotzil of Zinacantán. The book [milbrath2000star] has (on pages 37-40 and 260+) a summary of contemporary Maya constellations (of the Tzotzil of Zinacantán, and others); this is used to clarify some of the data. 9 constellations are identified (with line figures), plus names for many sky objects. Almost all form a coherent scene, with both natural and Christian themes.",
  "certainty": "There is very good certainty for the stars, and clear descriptions of the geometry. Only the stars and line figure for the Scorpion (009) are uncertain. There is an unidentified constellation: the Shonob h'elek' (possibly IAU Del), the high-backed sandals of the demons who killed Christ.",
