  "description": "Only 700 culturally viable Bororo survive, in 9 villages. Their myths were documented by Claude Lévi-Strauss: the Toribugu myth (with astronomical symbolism) was the key myth in his Mythologiques. The Bororo have a rather large body of astronomical information (they recognise and name a large number of stars and constellations). In [fabian1992space], the astronomical information is covered in Ch. 7 (p. 125-153) and Appendix A-B; the constellations identified are explicitly drawn with lines on two sky charts. The Bororo men have a nightly practice in June (when the skies are clear) of stellar observations at sunset (documented also in 1936 by Claude Lévi-Strauss). The stars provide a way to mark the flow of time, and integrate the Bororo social and ecological cycles. Observations are made on the relationships between stars and other stars, or fixed points on the celestial sphere (such as the zenith). In the Bororo myth on the creation of the stars, the stars are children which escaped from earth, because their mothers were attempting to keep them in an infantile state by not feeding them corn. (There is a similar Gê myth.) The Bororo observe the stars' regular cycles, and describe them as beautiful: not only because they are colourful and bright, but also because of their regularity, which expresses the essence of being for the Bororo, who see themselves as socially ordered (there is a structural relationship between the Bororo astronomy and society, in that each is defined with respect to the other). There are 16 identified light constellations, including 4 turtles. Other constellations were named but not identified: Cayman (Uwai), and Large-Antlered Atubo Deer (Atubo). As is common among indigenous South Americans, the Bororo also recognise certain dark areas of the Milky Way as constellations. Pari (The Rhea, an ostrich-like bird) is a part-light and part-dark constellation, with the dark a large black patch of the Milky Way It is one of the most popular Bororo constellations. The bird is described as either sleeping or running, despite the bird's leg and foot extending alongside its neck and head. (This inconsistency is not explained.) There are also two variants of Mortar and Pestle (Kaia and Kaibore), black parts of the Milky Way either near Sirius, or near the tail of IAU Sco. there is also a light cloud constellation: Pari Kigadurewu (White Rhea), a large light cloud of the Milky Way. This is said to resemble the black rhea, Pari, and be 'below' it---but was not identified. This data should be considered incomplete (surviving remnants), since stellar observations are related to the aboriginal lifestyle, which is fading. Accurate identification of stars and constellations is difficult to obtain, with the young Bororo ignorant of the names of all but the most prominent sky objects.",
