  "description": "The Kalina or Caribs are indigenous people in the northern coastal areas of South America. They lacked written language before the arrival of Europeans. 53 Carib stars and constellations were known between the 16th century and 1980, with many myths attached to them. Many of these are now unknown: only 20 stars and constellations (Table 2 in the source) remain both known and identified (have been drawn in the sky by villagers and referred to Western sky-maps). The drawings of the first 3 constellations are missing from the source for lack of reproduction rights, and the original sources (1931, 1943) could not be found. These missing constellations are: (001) Barbecue of the Sucker Catfish (Pakamu Sura-ri) which corresponds to Corvus, (002) Four-Eyed Fish (Kutaiyuman) which corresponds to Scorpio and Sagitta, and (003) without English gloss (Pakamuyuman) which also corresponds to Scorpio. This sky culture has 8 constellation line figures, one constellation without lines, and names for the Pleiades, the Milky Way, alf CMa (Sirius), alf Vir (Spica), and Venus. Two other constellations are only imprecisely identified and could not be included: Scorpio (Sibirisiyuman) as Scorpio, and Barbecue (Siritjo sura-ri) as unknown parts of Pegasus and of Andromeda.",
