  "description": "The Maricopa live in south-central Arizona, in the Southwest. The information is attributed to the anthropologist Leslie Spier and dated 1929-1930 (exact reference unclear). Only 4 constellations have lines; another (Mountain Sheep) is without lines. There are other constellations documented, such as Earth Doctor (2 stars in Scorpius) and Scorpion (other stars in Scorpius), but the exact stars have not been identified. Other constellations are identified with modern ones but without confirming any lines (they are not included here). The constellations represent or refer to myth characters: Coyote, Cold, Spider, Fox, Earth Doctor.",
