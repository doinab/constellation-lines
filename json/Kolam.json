  "description": "The Kolams (also called the Kolowars) are an ancient tribe mostly spread in south Central India, speaking a Dravidian language, co-located with the Gond and Banjara tribes. The population size is around 400,000. They were foragers until 1940-1950, and practised slash-and-burn cultivation using hoes and digging sticks; at the time of documentation they were agricultural. They have historically (1200 AD) served as priests for another co-located tribe, the Gonds (but are genetically distinct). The astronomy is extensive, if overly generalised: they do not seem to record changes in the sky over the year, and they recall the sky only during the pre-monsoon period when it is well observed. They borrow traditions from the Gonds, who retained more detailed descriptions of some of these common constellations. Besides the 7 lined constellations, three others are unidentified. One is named in two villages, but remains unidentified: the Danedare Pila, a spiral-shaped asterism (either the tail of Scorpius, or a counter-clockwise spiral of stars that also looks like a snake about 10 deg. east of Scorpius). Another constellation in Leo is also named in two villages, having been borrowed from the Gond tribe, but is not well identified by the Kolams: Murda (a dead body). Also, in Taurus is (in five villages) Bhori, a bird (Aldebaran) with two unidentified eggs.",

It is also known as the belt of a hunter, and the region around the Orion Nebula as a sword. (This may be a weak memory of the original Hindu myth which sees the entire Orion as a deer and the three stars of the belt as an arrow.) In one village, the entire Orion is included, not just the belt (but this structure is not identified). In another village, the region around Orion is a farming scene (like that around Sirius, alf CMa) with Medi, Kalave and Tandel or Aidal (a bull).",
