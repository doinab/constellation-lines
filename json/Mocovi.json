  "description": "The Mocoví (or Moqoit) are an indigenous people of the Gran Chaco in South America. The present-day Mocoví population consists of 18000 people, most in the Argentine provinces of Chaco and Santa Fe. The Mocoví language belongs to the Guaycurú linguistic group, as do the Toba, Abipones, Pilagás and Caduveos. Before coming under the influence of missionaries, they were migratory hunters (the favored species of game animals were deer, peccaries, and rheas), fishers, and gatherers. Today, the Mocoví have become assimilated, their culture has undergone substantial change, and only a minority have retained their native language. They had and still have a great practical knowledge of the night sky, for orientation and time-telling. The celestial plane, one of the three planes of the Mocoví cosmos, is called Piguim. This is a cold region, where atmospheric phenomena (winds, rain, thunder, lightning) belong. The celestial plane is hostile to humans, but is inhabited by powerful beings who look like the Mocoví but belong to mythical time, owners of astronomical and atmospheric phenomena. The vast majority of these celestial inhabitants are women: the celestial (and many Mocoví constellations) are associated with abundance, since almost all of the water in this region of Chaco is rain water. Most of the Mocoví asterisms are within or near the Milky Way, which acts as an articulating axis of the Mocoví cosmos. There are 12 identified constellations (of which 9 lined), and names for many sky objects. The source identifies stars and draws some line figures. Another Corral of the Dog (native: Qo'parit pioq) (similar to CON Mocovi 001) has not been identified.",
